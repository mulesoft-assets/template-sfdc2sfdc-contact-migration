As a Salesforce admin I want to syncronize contacts between two Salesfoce orgs.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating contacts from one Salesfoce instance to another, being able to specify filtering criterias and desired behaviour when a contact already exists in the destination org. 

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in  Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the Salesforce Org A and query all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each SFDC Contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the SFDC Org B and if the last updated date of the later is greater than the one of SFDC Org A.
The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create them in SFDC Org B.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will both otput statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch excecution.
In any event the Anypoint Template can be configure to also move over the Account to which the Contact is related. The application can either, create the Account if it doesn't exitis, assing the Contact to a pre existing Account in Salesforce instance B, or do nothing in what regards to the Account.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

In any of the ways you would like to run this Anypoint Template, here is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>

**Application configuration**
+ http.port `9090` 
+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`
+ account.id.in.b `001n0000003fMWXAA2`

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the three following values: 

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the contact over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the contact's account should this is not pressent in the Salesforce instance B.
+ **assignDummyAccount**: it will assign the cotact to an pre existing account in Salesforce instance B. For this it will use the value of  `account.id.in.b`. Finding the Id of the desired Account can be done by executing in your **Sales Force Developer Console** the following query: `SELECT Id, Name, Description FROM Account`.

**Salesforce Connector configuration for company A**

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Contacts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Anypoint Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `synccontacts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Contacts migrated and filtered by the criteria specified.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow responsible of excecuting the logic.
For the pourpose of this particular Anypoint Template the *mainFlow* just excecutes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
